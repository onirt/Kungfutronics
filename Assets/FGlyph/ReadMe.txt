									1. Tutorial
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visit : https://youtu.be/CallwP0KC-Q
This is a video tutorial demonstrating exactly how to add presets and then match drawings.

								2. Components included
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package contains:
- a demoscene to demonstrate the tool
- two textures to load 
- an event script to catch the result
- two prefabs that can be dragged and dropped into any scene

					3. Texture REQUIREMENTS for loading perfect presets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No AI is running to identify the strokes, only a mathematical algorithm, thus the following requirements:
- Texture must have no drawn pixels on the edges 
- Any pixel on the texture should not have more than 2 other pixels (separate strokes by 1 pixel radius)
- Because of the above requirement, a stroke should be 1 pixel wide
